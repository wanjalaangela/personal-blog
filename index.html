            <div class="excerpt">

                <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-2xl"></i>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a
                    traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman
                    who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.<i
                        class="fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-2xl"></i></p>
            </div>
            <p class='reflections' >The quote above made me understand  the painful truth about relationship expectations and  the aspect of patriarchy in both Trevor’s story and  the society today.
                The quote brings out the contradiction that comes from men being attracted to strong and independent women ,but the moment they start a relationship ,they try to manipulate or rather 
                control them to fit the traditional gender expectations.
                Even in today’s world,this is something that is happening .Confident,educated and successful  women who posses all the qualities you can think and admire of ,tend to oftenly get the 
                pressure to “soften” once they get in a relationship or even marriage ,in the name of “prioritizing the family ,husband and children”.
                I’ve heard stories from podcasts,my family and even friends of how their partners were very proud of their independence , ambitions and self awareness but  years into the marriage they <br>
                expected them to be “traditional” and  kept being told the phrase “you have to start behaving like a wife”. <br>
                The phrase “you have to start behaving like a wife” makes me question and wonder how an ideal wife looks,behaves like?<br>
                Personally, I think independence ,confidence,self awareness and freedom is attractive until it literally challenges someone’s idea of what a wife should be.And this the description of Abel 
                ,he loved the idea of Patricia being strong but again felt threatened by the reality of that. This is what led to the control and the violence that is explained in the book.<br>
                As a society I think we have a long way to go in  defining what an ideal relationship is. Ideal relationships should be growing strong together rather than growing strong over your wife.
                It should be about building each other,not harassing one to fit some toxic expectation.<br>
                “Today’s man wants a submissive provider not a wife”
